# Predictive Modeling for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

Applied Data Science M.S. - University of San Diego
ADS-503: Predicitve Modeling

### Abstract: 
This project aims to accurately detect and diagnose breast cancer by utilizing predictive modeling techniques applied to digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The FNA images are used to compute various features that describe the characteristics of cell nuclei present in the images. These features include radius (mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter), texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values), perimeter, area, smoothness (local variation in radius lengths), compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0), concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour), concave points (number of concave portions of the contour), symmetry, and fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1). The dataset also includes an ID number and a diagnosis (malignant or benign) for each sample. By leveraging these features and employing predictive modeling techniques, the project seeks to achieve accurate breast cancer detection and diagnosis.
