# Predictive Modeling for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

ADS-503: Predicitve Modeling

Abstract: This project aims to accurately detect and diagnose breast cancer by utilizing predictive modeling techniques applied to digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The FNA images are used to compute various features that describe the characteristics of cell nuclei present in the images. These features include radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. The dataset also includes an ID number and a diagnosis (malignant or benign) for each sample. By leveraging these features and employing predictive modeling techniques, the project seeks to achieve accurate breast cancer detection and diagnosis.
